# A Server that run on both Windows and Unix-like systems
A server written entirely in C by me, this works both in Windows and Unix-like systems and it can execute some command (e.g. list directory, delete files, upload files, download file, and other) from bash or cmd prompt, calling it from internet browser and using a variety of keywords in the url. This implement basic authentication written by me and implement the http protocol also written by me.
