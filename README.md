# A Windows/Unix-like server
A server written entirely in C by me, this works both in Windows and Unix-like systems and it can execute some command (e.g. list directory, delete files, upload files, download file, and other) from bash or cmd prompt, calling it from internet browser and using a variety of keywords in the url. This implement basic authentication and the http protocol both written by me.
